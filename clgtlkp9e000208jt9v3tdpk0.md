[**Lens**](https://k8slens.dev/) is Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Kubernetes (K8S). It plays an instrumental part in running Kubernetes in the world, a true magic that we can say.

It helps in managing your Kubernetes clusters in a much beginner-friendly format which makes it easier even for the one who doesn't know much about Kubernetes and just starting up in the journey.

LensIDE is the FOSS (Free & OpenSource Software) by Mirantis which is the largest and most Advanced Kubernetes platform in the world with more than 700k users every month.

It can run on your local system or on the cloud and help you manage your Kubernetes clusters in deeper detail about your pods, deployments, images, containers and a lot more.

## Dashboard

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682258473429/e65b2c4d-ffb3-43fb-8095-f8780ef0b899.png align="center")

Here you can see their entire web link where you can follow them on socials like Twitter, read out their blogs to navigate to their proper usage and a lot more useful links for sure.

Now to access our Clusters we can click on the Clusters section in the left column of our IDE.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682258542288/8af616c6-3bc4-496d-b00d-74b5e671ec00.png align="center")

Here you would be able to see all the clusters in the dashboard which you made and here you would also be able to see **minikube** also and other clusters as well as their locations also where their kubeconfig files are located. 'kubeconfig' file allows us to access all our clusters and everything.

Also, we would be able to see '**lens-demo**' which is our lens demo that is running on **civo**.

### Civo

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682258671318/d3dc2165-aa0e-4963-b595-e19d2883b63d.png align="center")

**Civo** is a cloud-native service provider whose mission is to provide companies to host their core application with ease increasing speed, productivity and finally reducing cost. It is just incredibly fast and can launch a cluster within 90 seconds compared to other cloud providers which take about 10-12 minutes and are super efficient and cheap which cost only about $5 a month.

**Civo** can help you work with multi-node infrastructure in minikube we can only work with a single node(node is generally where clusters are running) but when we will be working with multiple computers at a time then at that time multi noded infrastructure will be needed and thus we will have to use a cloud provider such as civo.

Now as we move into the cluster section and get to enter into one of the clusters we will find the CPU, Memory and Number of Pods running every detail get to enter commands using a built-in terminal and interact with Kubernetes CLI(Command line tool).

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682260353171/c4eb630d-07e0-4193-af2d-edfce7e58db9.png align="center")

Lens-IDE has multi-cluster management by which we can control and manage various different clusters from the same IDE. We can also pin our clusters in the left sidebar as a kind of sidebar named a **Hot-bar** here which makes it pretty handy as well to work with the multi-clusters in a proper and well-structured dedicated manner according to us & able to switch between different clusters with no efforts.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682264014758/10e2361e-44ab-4be6-9749-ecdd8f63aa2f.png align="center")

It also has a feature to switch to some **Prometheus** by right-clicking to some cluster and going into the settings, where you can also choose to hide some matrices and information from UI like some node, pod, deployment, etc of your choice. We can also look out for namespaces and a lot more features as well.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682264024601/62a242fb-96cc-4708-9f34-d96136949b29.png align="center")

In Lens IDE when we use an in-built terminal command line in separate clusters like in the case of minikube we will be using minikube then we will see that the GitVersion for both the clusters- minikube and civo environment will be different as in the case of civo cluster, it uses correct cluster API endpoint hence there will be a correct cluster API endpoint in case of civo cluster while for minikube there will be the use of the dedicated downloaded version.

In addition to it, we may think about how it contains the information about all the pods and everything so actually, it read all our kube/config file containing all the info about how will it connect to your cluster which is present in your home directory.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682265329705/4cb8ebc0-ff90-475d-8f97-1b036a498a14.png align="center")

Now in the above picture, we are shown the information about the cluster, and we can also see that in minikube we have only one node so only one cluster is shown in it. We can get all the info on the node present in the cluster and we can also interact with our node by going into the node-shell.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682264329332/f33dbb9d-c75c-43d5-b57d-b1b8239d6fd4.png align="center")

**Workloads** mean all objects that I m running in a cluster like pods, deployments, demonsets, etc. We can also work with the namespaces as well in the workloads.

By clicking on any of the pods we can get access to a lot of information about CPU, Memory, Networking information, filesystem, time of creation, name, label, Pod IP, Status, Controlled by, Node, Pod Logs & a lot more awesome features.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682265206723/51fc5407-b686-4f5e-b8ce-395ac2b208f4.png align="center")

**Configuration** section contains a lot more tools and info about our ConfigMaps, Secrets, Resource Quotas, etc . **ConfigMaps** are basically API Objects which contain non-confidential data in key-value pairs.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682264820671/d9504764-521f-4ad9-940f-09b316a852ac.png align="center")

**Network** section contains information about Networking information where we can find info about our kube-DNS, cluster IPs, Ports, type, Session availability, Status and External IP.

**Storage** section contains info about all the Persistent Volmes, Storage Volumes & their paths, status, memory usage and a lot more features as well.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682264940921/bb6ec75e-4293-4361-bbe8-5d4bd138c6e7.png align="center")

**Namespaces** section involves the listing of all namespaces and you can also create your namespace.

Besides these amazing features, the lens also has an **Events** Section to check out all the events taking place and **Access control** and various features allowing you to share your access to your Kubernetes clusters with the other developers without worrying about any problematic stuff.

# Creating Resources- where Magic happens

So now to create resources which can be Pods, Ingress, Deployment, Roles, RoleBinding, Job and a lot more templates, LensIDE is an amazing tool that can be used to create templates with YAML manifest without any problem saving up a lot of time. Making the use of LensIDE a lot easier for an absolute beginner as well.

To create resources go through these steps:--

* At the bottom, we might find out some CLI or logs being opened up easily & a plus(+) sign at the end.

* Click on it and select Create Resources out of it.

* From the terminal go to Select Template and choose any one which you want to create and edit it according to you.

* Now after you are done editing it out click on Create or Create & Close.
    
* You will see a message dropping in the IDEdropping the message static-web is been created.
