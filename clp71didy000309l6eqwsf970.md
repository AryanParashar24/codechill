## **Introduction to Go**

Go is a modern programming language, which was developed by Google in 2009 and OpenSourced in 2010 which highly focuses on simplicity, safety and readability, which is designed for building large-scale concurrent applications, especially network services.

Go is good and often preferred for creating DevOps tools because of its efficiency, better parallel processing handling and concurrency-enabling apps and architecture to automate multiple tasks and handling including test checks, permission enabling, SDKs designing, chaos tests and a lot more features as well.

DevOps requires having some knowledge of a programming language to ensure that implementing its principles yields the maximum expected result. Go is a lightweight programming language, and it enables you to write your code once, compile and run anywhere, even on multi-platform or multi-architecture environments.

If you want to know more about [**Docker**](https://codechill.hashnode.dev/docker-basics-architecture) or [Golang](https://codechill.hashnode.dev/unveiling-the-power-of-go-why-googles-go-language-is-taking-over-the-tech-world) as well as their infrastructure, the reason for their development and how they work, check out my earlier blogs.

# Reason for its High Usability

Golang is a highly popular language in Cloud-native which is used for creating a lot of applications, tools, monitoring interfaces and management applications as well. Many networking and management domains like Chaos Engineering, Platform Engineering and a lot of other sectors use Golang to build projects, and applications, write tests, and add integrations, extensions, and other interesting features to increase usability and user experience.

Golang is a popular tool among DevOps professionals, a statically typed and loved programming language because of its build and easy deployment feature; it is the fourth most loved programming language and the third-highest paying language according to a survey by [StackOverflow.](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-what-languages-are-associated-with-the-highest-salaries-worldwide) Also, in the survey, it was noted that DevOps professionals liked using Go for their work. Another [survey by HackerEarth](https://recruit-c7ff.kxcdn.com/recruit/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/he-developer-survey-2020.pdf) also revealed that 32% of developers prefer using Go as their programming language.

Golang is a highly useful language due to some of its magnificent use cases across the domain:

* **Concurrency**: This feature comes in handy when you need functions to run independently of the other. Concurrency is executed with a goroutine thread of execution, but the goroutine thread should be added at the language level (during coding) before running the function.
    
* **Garbage collection**: this feature lightens the memory allocations in your program by tracking down any less-important file taking up space. It manages both efficient and concurrent memory.
    
* **Multi-platform**: With this feature of the Go programming language, thereâ€™s no need to worry about starting your coding all over again when you move to a new platform.
    
* **Security**: As speed and security donâ€™t go hand-in-hand in some aspects of DevOps, itâ€™s different with Go. Go has a very low vulnerability to attacks and still maintains speed, and the compiler always catches errors.
    
* **Ease by compilation**: This feature in Go is the one we run our code through to filter errors and generate a binary or executable file before running the program.

## Concurrency leveraging the Modern Cloud Native Applications arch.

Modern Applications need to manage a lot of workloads and functions going on at different instances serving different functionalities, requesting servers for the output and giving input all at once to a lot of users located at different geographical locations with different network traffic.

With such heavy traffic, every developer on the platform expects the application to run all of these services without any delay. Here the concept of Concurrency and Parallelism hops in for developers, to maintain multiple requests without delaying any of them and maintain the non-stop continuous flow of their services.

Golang allows developers to maintain this pace and method without downloading any additional libraries like Python in a much simpler and well-structured manner. By using Goroutines which are functions that make concurrency work natively in these system software and frameworks.  
Channels work as a medium of communication for Goroutines, making it work efficiently by communicating with other Goroutine threads.

# Contribution in Kubernetes

## Kubernetes

**Kubernetes** is a famous orchestration platform used by a lot of platforms to automate and manage their microservices and resources, which brings it forward in the queue of leveraging technologies thus becoming the mandatory tool to be used within the community.

Kubernetes was developed with a similar idea for which Golang was developed, to automate and run several actions and processes for handling different applications and requests in parallel without interrupting each other by distributing these into microservices to decrease the complexity and dependency of one calculation on some other calculation running in parallel with it on some other unit. To achieve this level of complexity, there is a need for a matching programming language. Go is simple and minimalist; it has good string processing, compilation, low-level system calls, and concurrency features, which are the elements needed to make Kubernetes a complete containerization system.

## Docker

**<mark>Go is an efficient low-level programming language</mark>** but can handle system projects; this is part of why the Docker team adopted Go to build Docker. The Go language empowered the team to work with their preferred operating system- Linux.

Docker's virtualization technology is responsive because of Go, and it makes Docker users able to incorporate Docker's capabilities into their environment easily. Go, with its ability to execute low-level system calls, made building Docker faster and less time-consuming than other programming languages. It is an advantage to the Docker team because Docker doesnâ€™t require many system resources to run it.
