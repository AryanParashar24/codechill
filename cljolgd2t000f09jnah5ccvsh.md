Walking onto this path of procuring as many as skills I, and pushing up the bar of potential to a whole another level every day, I have successfully completed the first half of 2023. Gathered up a lot of skills and knowledge in different stacks including cloud computing, cloud Native, Web-development, MERN Stack and Machine learning, publishing a total of 9 blogs which is going to add up to 10 after I released this blog, and somehow managed to get a total of 1500 views which doesn't stand out to be an outlasting figure at all but for a newbie like me who actually took blogging seriously in the last 3 months holds out to be at least a fair number for sure.

Started up the journey with the general mindset same as every other Computer Science student practicing Data Structure & Algorithm, competitive programming and Web-development after getting pumped up by the movies we watched in our childhood like Iron Man, The Social Network and The Imitation Game. With not knowing any blogging community or even any blogging app's name other than just the concept of Blogging, practicing DSA was quite an easy task in the starting.

By the start of the year 2023, I became active on Twitter due to the huge existence of all the developer's communities on this platform and the ones which I was also a part of, like WeMakeDevs, Eddie hub, Kube, Kube simplify and Virtual Tech School. I get to know about the importance of blogging by @[Kunal Kushwaha](@kunalk) , @[Eddie Jaoude](@eddiejaoude) , @[Saiyam Pathak](@Saiyampathak) and a lot more folks as a result of which I started blogging and released my first blog at the end of January 2023.

* Blogging surely brings up a hell lot of networks, appraises, opportunities, knowledge and data about the trends and projects taking place in the Tech World. To write more blogs and get to know about the latest trends going on in the Tech Space, we get into the habit of reading blogs written by other people and get to learn from the experience of other people which might help us eventually in increasing our efficiency by providing different ways by which we can make our way out of the problem which we might get stuck in the future.
    
* To publish more and more blogs and create a wide spectrum of different stacks, blogging really pushes us to learn about different stacks, tools and software which adds up a lot more knowledge in our scope that wouldn't have been possible with the bare minimum efforts from our side.
    
* As a result of this knowledge we acquired in different stacks, we get to know a lot of people resulting in building up a nice network and chances of getting various opportunities that might build our Resume more impressive.
    
* We acquire a lot of skills not only in tech and programming but also in nurturing our better communication skills, networking and presenting ourselves and our data in a much more impressive format.
    
* Even in the future, if we plan to upload videos on YouTube according to our knowledge and skills, then we would be all ready with a lot of knowledge and a network with which we could get help in the form of tips or some coffee interviews with the folks from our network.
    
* Blogging also brings up Proof of Work in the real world due to the sharing of our knowledge based on the skills we acquire, based on which we can also collaborate with people engaged in different stacks and projects.
    

Although, I haven't got so many opportunities based on which i would have got any chance to earn a lot as i am still in the learning phase and still participating a lot of events and hackathons (which is again due to the information and news i get by Hashnode and Twitter winning a lot of swwags and prizes by winnings), but surely Blogging helped in Strengthenning my skills and profile with which, surely i would get a hell lot more opportunities when compared to any other folk due to the advantages and help that it would provide me in the above points.
